# leap-year-check
gregorian calender leap year validator

# description
we discussed this topic in a programming logic and design class I took while recieving my formal education. 
The book we were reading at the time, had an expression that said year 1700 was a leap year, when in-fact it is not.
My teacher challenged me to create a dynamic page that had a corrected version, and here it is! If you notice a flaw in the 
expression, please inform me because I love to learn about this topic of the leap year check!
